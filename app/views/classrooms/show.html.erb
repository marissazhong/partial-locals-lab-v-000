Classroom Info
<p>
  <%= render partial: 'classrooms/classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render 'students/student' %>
<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @student} %>
<% end %>
